[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a026dcc6-920b-4f08-b6ff-535e61f4190a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/heuristic-mccarthy-2e808b/deploys)

I built this website with Tailwind CSS, vue.js, Gridsome and Netlify.  Originally I started with plain HTML5, migrated to vue.js and tailwindcss with vue-router and vue-cli.  After some looking around, I've discovered Vuepress and eventually [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/).  I recommend [Gridsom Starters](https://gridsome.org/starters/). I went with [Gridsome Portfolio Starter](https://gridsome.org/starters/gridsome-portfolio-starter/) by Andre Madarang due to the dark/light mode and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).  

Since then, I have made it my own.
